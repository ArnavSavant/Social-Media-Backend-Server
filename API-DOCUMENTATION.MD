### Postman Collection

To simplify testing the API endpoints, a Postman collection is included in this project.

1. **Import the Collection**:
   - Open Postman.
   - Click on "Import" in the top left corner.
   - Select "Choose Files" and import the `SocialMediaPlatform.postman_collection.json` file.

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure you have an environment set up in Postman with the following variables:
     - `token` (JWT token for authentication).

3. **Execute the Requests**:
   - After importing, you will see a collection named "Social Media Platform".
   - Expand the collection to see all available API requests.
   - Click on any request to see its details and execute it.

The collection covers all available API endpoints for the project, including user authentication, post management, commenting, and liking posts.
